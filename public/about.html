<h1>About Brian</h1>
<p>Working as an Agent at Seniors chioice Inc., Brian is doing double duty, learning web development to further increase his skillset in IT and technology.
While also being an agent for senior insurance products, and keeping up to date on plans and helping with claims. 
</p>

<p>Since Seniors Choice Inc. is essentially two agents with around 1,000 customers, a better functioning website is becoming
   crucial to giving customers a resource to use that they can feel comfortable with.
   Many seniors will not call because they do not want to bother somebody who is busy.
   With more and more seniors being taught technology as part of their jobs, Internet resources are becoming more popular among them.</p>

<p>Website builders like godaddy and wix are great tools for a store. But when you get into complexities that are not focused on sales, these builders fall flat.
  Websites builders are built more for blogs or sales. <br />

  Blogs are great if you are charting out your story, but not so much on the customer service side. They have a limited use and recovering previous information gets harder over time. <br />

  Stores are great until you are gettign commisions. We are selling a product that our Customer doesn't pay us for, we get commision from the insurance companies and thus a store site isn't very helpful.
  we do need the funnel system but it isn't for money transactions which is where build sites are designed to drive enrything to. <br /></p>
  
  <p>Now, we can fight with builders, or learn how to build our own. So here we are, learning to build and grow for our customers.</p>
